# Flask-Webapp
This project is a training exercise for:

1) web development -- creating a microservices-based web application using Python's Flask
2) development operations -- using Docker, Terraform, Kubernetes, Prometheus, and other tools. 

The goal is to gain hands-on experience with these technologies and learn how to build and deploy a scalable and fault-tolerant system. The application consists of several services, including authentication, catalog, orders, and payments, that communicate with each other using RESTful APIs. Each service is designed as a Docker container and deployed to a Kubernetes cluster using Terraform. Prometheus is used for monitoring the health and performance of the system.
