# Web-App-Deployed
This project is a training exercise for:

1) web development -- creating a microservices-based web application using best practices with Python Flask.
2) development operations -- gaining familiarity with common devops tools like Docker, Terraform, Kubernetes, and Prometheus. 

The goal is to gain hands-on experience with these technologies and learn how to build and deploy a scalable and fault-tolerant system. The application will consist of several services, including authentication, catalog, and orders, which will communicate with each other using RESTful APIs. Each service will be designed as a Docker container.

Terraform will be used to set up and manage the infrastructure resources required for deploying the application, including the Kubernetes cluster. The Docker containers will be deployed onto the Kubernetes cluster, which will handle the orchestration, scaling, and management of the application. Prometheus will be used for monitoring the health and performance of the system.
