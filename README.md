# Web-App-Deployed
This project is a training exercise for:

### Web development
Building a microservices-based web application with separate authentication, catalog, and orders services that communicate via RESTful APIs.
### Containerization
Packaging each service as a Docker container, enabling consistent deployment and runtime environments across different stages of the application                       lifecycle.
### Kubernetes
Orchestrating and managing containerized applications to ensure scalability, fault tolerance, and efficient resource utilization.
### Amazon EKS
Leveraging the power of AWS to host and maintain a Kubernetes cluster, simplifying the process of deploying and managing containerized                                 applications at scale.
### Monitoring
Using Prometheus to track the performance and health of the application's services, ensuring reliability and rapid troubleshooting.
