# Web-App-Deployed
This project is a training exercise for:

1) web development -- creating a microservices-based web application using Python's Flask.
2) development operations -- gaining familiarity with common devops tools like Docker, Terraform, Kubernetes, and Prometheus. 

The goal is to gain hands-on experience with these technologies and learn how to build and deploy a scalable and fault-tolerant system. The application will consist of several services, including authentication, catalog, and orders, which will communicate with each other using RESTful APIs. Each service will be designed as a Docker container and deployed to a Kubernetes cluster using Terraform. Prometheus will be used for monitoring the health and performance of the system.
