# Web-App-Deployed
This project is a training exercise for:

1) web development -- creating a microservices-based web application 
2) containerization -- deploying and monitoring containerized services

The goal of this project is to deepen our understanding of these concepts and enhance our ability to build and deploy scalable, fault-tolerant systems. The application will consist of several services, including authentication, catalog, and orders, which will communicate with each other using RESTful APIs. Each service will be designed as a Docker container to be deployed onto the Kubernetes cluster, which will handle the orchestration, scaling, and management of the application. Prometheus will be used for monitoring the health and performance of the system.
