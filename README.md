# Web-App-Deployed
This project is a training exercise combining multiple disciplines to build a containerized web application. By interweaving these disciplines, this project aims to showcase a scalable, fault-tolerant approach to modern web development and devops.

### Web development
Designing a microservices-based web application consisting of authentication and portfolio services that seamlessly communicate via RESTful APIs, forming the foundation of the application using flask.
### Containerization
Utilizing Docker to package each service into a container, ensuring consistent deployment and runtime environments throughout the application lifecycle, providing a strong basis for scalability and manageability.
### Networking
Establishing a secure and functional network to host the application on multiple devices, initially self-hosted for learning purposes and cost-efficiency, enabling seamless integration with containerization and Kubernetes.
### Kubernetes
Leveraging Kubernetes for the orchestration and management of containerized applications, ensuring scalability, fault tolerance, and efficient resource utilization, working in harmony with the network and containerization aspects.
### Cloud
Transitioning to AWS and Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) for a more robust, cloud-based solution that simplifies the deployment and management of the application at scale, elevating the project's capabilities and resilience.
### Monitoring
Implementing Prometheus for monitoring the performance and health of the application's services across all stages, ensuring reliability and rapid troubleshooting, tying together all aspects of the project for a comprehensive understanding of the system.
